    <h1>Tokyo, Japan</h1>

    <p>
        Tokyo is my favorite city because it perfectly blends modern technology with
        traditional culture. You can find ancient temples next to futuristic buildings,
        which makes the city unique and exciting.
    </p>

    <p>
        The city offers amazing food, efficient public transportation, and countless
        places to explore, from busy shopping districts to peaceful parks and shrines.
